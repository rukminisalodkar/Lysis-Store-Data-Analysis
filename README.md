# Lysis-Store-Data-Analysis
Lysis Store Data Analysis is a comprehensive analysis of sales data of the year 2022 for Lysis to understand customer trends and based on them arrive at solutions to increase sales in 2023.

Key analytical questions explored in this project are:
1. What were the total sales and orders in 2022?
2. What were the top 10 states contributing the most to sales?
3. Who purchases more? Men or Women
4. What are the different channels that were used?
5. Which months saw a increase in sales?
6. Which clothing category was sold more in 2022?
7. What were the different order statuses?
8. Which age group is more likely to order products the most in 2022?

The store data analysis was carried out using Microsoft Excel and hence involves the following processes:
- Data Cleaning: Standardized the formatting, handled the mixed data types in the same column
- Data Processing: Used IF function to establish age groups (Adult: 30 to 49, Teenager: Below 30, Senior: Above 49) in order to derive
  meaningful insights.
- Pivot Tables: Used Pivot Tables to create insightful summaries on sales, orders, categories, etc.
- Pivot Charts: Developed Bar charts, pie charts and slicers.
- Dashboard: Using the above process, created a annual report for Lysis.

Key insights derived from the analysis:
1. Women are more likely to buy products than men.
2. Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu are the Top 5 states for sales.
3. Adults (30-49 years old) are more likely to order products online
4. The month of March witnessed the highest number of sales and orders.
5. Channels like Amazon, Myntra and Flipkart contribute the most.
6. Sets are the most sold product.
7. Majority of the orders are delivered just right.

Final recommendation:
In order to grow sales for 2023, Lysis needs to focus on women as target customers in the age group 30-49 years. It can also expand its sales in the Top 10 states keeping in mind the target customers. Lysis can mainly focus on Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra by introducing offers, discounts and varieties/designs in their most sold products. This is will enhance their e-commerce presence, thus boosting sales. The company can also take advantage of the festive season from October to March to get more orders and sales.
